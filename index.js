// Sales Path
// A car manufacturer holds their distribution system in the form of a tree
// (not necessarily a binary tree) The root is the company itself, and every
// node in the tree represents a car distributor that receives cars from the
// parent node and ships them to its children NodeList. The leaf nodes are 
// car dealerships that sell cars direct to consumers. In addition, every node
// holds an interger that is the cost of shipping a car to it.

//example:

//       0

// 4  2  0  1  5
